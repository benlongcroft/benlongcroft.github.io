    <p>A while ago, I was working on a project building a website for a client when the whole thing fell through and I was left with this cool website, and nothing to do with it. Suddenly, I had a brainwave - what if I made my own website, like a proper web developer. The plan seemed logical, a place to show off my projects, skills and act as an online portfolio for employers, clients and friends alike. So welcome!</p>
<p>This website is built using Flask (because nothing more was needed!) and is a primarily static site. I used the flask flat-pages library as the static site generator and while I could have used a static site generator such as Hugo or Jekyll, I wanted to use flask to give myself a bit more control and expand to make the website slightly more dynamic if necessary. I like the idea of being able to add further functionality if necessary, especially in terms of login features and subdomains in order to host demo versions for freelance web clients I might be working for.</p>
<p>Anyway, please feel free to explore this new site and check out some of the stuff I've been working on. There's lots of cool stuff to try such as games, tools and toys (if you don't mind a bit of Git CLI action!)</p>
