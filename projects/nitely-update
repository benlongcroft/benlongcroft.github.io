    <p>Nitely started as a project to pass some time during lockdown and it really snowballed and turned into something that taught me a lot of important lessons and skills. The concept was to produce a machine learning based tool that could recommend nights out, not simply a single venue but multiple venues over the course of an evening to build a whole 'night out'. I started it in lockdown after hearing about how much trouble the hospitality industry would be in post-covid and I thought that it might help, as well as providing an interesting project to fill my time. </p>

<p>It utilised NLP with spaCy, Google Places API as well as an eclectic set of data sources that allowed me to process data on a nightclubs, bars and restaurants in Newcastle. This data was difficult to find initially and even more of a pain to wrangle into a common format however, once I did - I could use the NLP powers of spaCy to parse for keywords, themes and other data to process. This helped build dictionaries of words with spatial mappings to the nightclub entities. </p>
<p>Each club was represented via a multidimensional vector (300) that could be mapped spatially other venues to look for similarities. This was through an algorithm called K2K which I devised and uses keyword mapping and dimensionality reduction to produce these vectors, store them and compare them against user vectors - generated from user preferences and choices while using NITELY. This was paired with shortest path heuristics to ensure that venues were not only similar in atmosphere, but also in distance. </p>

<p>This was all great at first, however I soon ran into some heavy processing costs in order to run this on a large scale as well as API costs and server hire which prevented this project from progressing any further. This was a blow but I think by this point I needed a break from NITELY too, I had been working on it for well over a year and it was good to step back and take some time to think about other projects (especially those with <em>some</em> financial incentive!) </p>
<p>All the code is available to see on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/benlongcroft/Nitely-Code-Base">here</a> and if you feel you have any ideas or changes please don't hesitate to let me know! It's a project I may come back to for a complete rethink in the future, but one that for the moment needs to sit for a while so I can reconsider the important aspects and maybe build some capital to run it in a cost-efficient way. </p>
